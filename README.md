# CS205 Final Project Codebase
This is a repo for CS205 final project on nuclei image segmentation.
You can find the presentation slides under this home directory.

The dataset is in ```data.zip``` file, which has a simplified folder structure compared to the raw format on Kaggle.

We implemented and parallelized three models for nuclei segmentation: Boruvka's Algorithm, Otsu's Method and UNet.
The folders ```boruvka, otsu``` and ```unet``` contain the corresponding implementations.

Here are some example outputs or the three methods:
